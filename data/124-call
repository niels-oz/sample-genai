Insurance Customer (IC): calling the insurance company

Customer Service Agent (CSA): answering the call Thank you for calling [Insurance Company Name]. My name is Lisa, and I'm here to assist you. How can I help you today?

IC: This is [Customer's Name], and I've had it with your company! I can't believe you rejected my claim for the accident I had last month. I pay you guys a fortune, and this is how you treat me?

CSA: I understand your frustration, [Customer's Name]. I'm here to help address your concerns. Can you please provide me with your policy number and some details about the claim that was rejected?

IC: Ugh, fine. My policy number is [Policy Number]. I submitted a claim for the accident I had on [Date], and you people denied it, saying it wasn't covered. I need that money for repairs, and I'm not backing down on this.

CSA: Thank you for providing your policy number and details, [Customer's Name]. I'll look into this for you, but I want you to know that we take claims very seriously. Our decision is based on the policy terms and the circumstances of the incident. It may take a moment, but I'll do my best to assist you.

[The CSA reviews the claim and policy terms]

CSA: I've reviewed your claim, and it seems the denial was based on the policy terms. However, I understand that you're upset about this situation. Can you tell me more about the accident and the reasons provided for the denial?

IC: The accident was not my fault. Another driver rear-ended me at a red light. The police report and witness statements back that up. Yet you people are denying my claim? This is ridiculous!

CSA: I'm sorry to hear about the accident, [Customer's Name], and I can understand your frustration. It's essential to ensure all relevant information is considered. Can you please provide the claim number and any specific reasons for the denial that were mentioned in the letter or communication you received?

IC: I don't have the claim number with me, but they said the claim was denied because I didn't have the optional "collision" coverage. I never even knew that was an option! I'm not taking no for an answer.

CSA: Thank you for the additional information. I understand your concern. It's important to review your policy to ensure you have the coverage you need. While I can't guarantee a change in the decision, I can escalate your case to our claims department for further review. They will investigate the circumstances and your coverage. In the meantime, I'll also help you review your policy to make sure you have the coverage you need going forward.

IC: You better escalate this, and quickly. And while we're at it, I want to review all my policies. If this isn't resolved to my satisfaction, I'm canceling everything I have with your company!

CSA: I will definitely escalate your claim for further review, [Customer's Name]. We value your business and will do our best to assist you. I'll also arrange for a policy review. We don't want you to make any hasty decisions. Please expect a call from our claims department soon. Thank you for your patience.
